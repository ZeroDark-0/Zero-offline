Hello, my name is [Zerodark]. I'm a passionate game developer and artist with a strong interest in 2D and 3D art.

I'm currently learning C#, data structures and algorithms, Blender, and Unity. I'm proficient in [C, C++, Python].

I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on game development projects. You can reach me on Discord, GitHub, ArtStation, and LinkedIn.
